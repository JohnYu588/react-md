# @react-md/core

Create an accessible React application with the [material design specifications]
and SCSS.

Check out the [documentation website] for demos, configuration guides,
and other documentation.

## [Installation]

```sh
npm install @react-md/core sass

# optionally install material icons as well
npm install @react-md/material-icons
```

```sh
yarn add @react-md/core sass

# optionally install material icons as well
yarn add @react-md/material-icons
```

## Typescript

The library is written and maintained in [Typescript] and it is recommended to
use in your application as well since there is no runtime type checking for
React props that cannot be caught by Typescript.
