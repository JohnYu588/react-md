Title: react-md 2.3.1

Date: 09/14/2020

Summary:

I released `v1.18.0` today but didn't realize that npm uses `--tag` while
`lerna` uses `--dist-tag` so `v1.18.0` was released under `latest` instead of
`previous`. This release is only to ensure that `v2` is set to `latest` and has
no other changes.

---

Title: react-md 2.3.0

Date: 09/10/2020

Summary:

This release is kind of a breaking change since the base `react-md` package no
longer has a `dist/css` folder for all the pre-compiled themes due to CDNs and
package managers rejecting this package for being too big. All the pre-compiled
themes will now be available through [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net)
instead. Check out the [CDN Links](/guides/cdn-links) for more info.

This release also changed the `ResizeObserver` to use a subscription model to
slightly increase performance when multiple `ResizeObserver`s are used on a
single page as well as fix some errors related to the
`ResizeObserver loop has been exceeded`. The `useResizeObserver` has been
updated to use the new API which requires `ref`s, but is still backwards
compatible. Due to this change, the `ResizeObserver` component has been
**deprecated** in favor of the `useResizeObserver` hook implementation.

Otherwise, there were a few new features added to the #button, #progress, and
#tree packages that you can reference below.

##### Documentation<!-- no-margin -->

- created a new example for the `@react-md/form` package to show how to use
  [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) with `react-md` for form
  validation. Check out the new example
  [here](/packages/form/demos#with-react-hook-form).
- updated sandboxes to use new CDN for pre-compiled themes (e83f47e)
- added documentation about using [CDN Links](/guides/cdn-links)
- added a simple umd example to show
  [CDN usage]({{GITHUB_FILE_URL}}/examples/umd) (ed6b62e)

##### Bug Fixes<!-- no-margin -->

- **@react-md/form:** added missing scss variables (ec8d675)
- **@react-md/states:** fixed `usePressedStates` to pass `onClick` like other
  state hooks (82cd676)

##### Features<!-- no-margin -->

- **@react-md/alert:** created and exported the default timeout and classnames
  (32bacc9)
- **@react-md/button:** added built-in support for rendering `CircularProgress`
  (c6c616b)
- **@react-md/button:** added support for disabled theme without disabling
  button (6a647e2)

Summary:

`rmd-theme-var(secondary)` to better match the v1 styles.

```sh
# replace EXAMPLE_NAME with the specific example you want to use
curl https://codeload.github.com/mlaursen/react-md/tar.gz/main | tar -xz --strip=2 react-md-main/examples/EXAMPLE_NAME
cd EXAMPLE_NAME
```

Next, install any dependencies:

```sh
npm install
# or with yarn
yarn
```

Next, initialize the git repository and add the first commit:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Finally, follow any instructions in the `README.md` about how to run the

Title: react-md 2.0.1

Date: 06/17/2020

Summary:

This is _technically_ a breaking change for the UMD bundle since this splits the
material-icon component wrappers into separate bundles to minimize the library's
size. I'm going with a patch bump though since it's only been two days since the
v2 release and it's highly doubtful that consumers of the library have fully
upgraded to v2 or even using the UMD bundle to begin with.

react-md will now be available as these bundles:

- Base `ReactMD` library:<br />
  https://unpkg.com/react-md@2.0.1/dist/umd/react-md.production.min.js
- `ReactMD` with `*FontIcon` components:<br />
  https://unpkg.com/react-md@2.0.1/dist/umd/react-md-with-font-icons.production.min.js
- `ReactMD` with `*SVGIcon` components:<br />
  https://unpkg.com/react-md@2.0.1/dist/umd/react-md-with-svg-icons.production.min.js

The
[advanced installation guide](/guides/advanced-installation#react-md--material-icons-umd-bundle)
and the [library size notes](/about#what39s-the-library-size) have been updated
for this information.

Title: react-md 2.0.0

Date: 06/15/2020

Read More: v2-release

Summary:<!-- bullets -->

The v2 release is a complete re-write of react-md to address the majority of
problems encountered while using v1. Unfortunately, this took a **lot** longer
than I had hoped since I ended up using this project to learn
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as well as the new
[React hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Even though there
are some missing components from v1, I think the new functionality outweighs it
and the components are scoped for a later release.

The 2.0.0 release of react-md features:

- Rewrite to Typescript
- New Behavior for Determining the Current Application Size
- New Theme API
- New Utility SCSS Functions and Mixins
- SCSS Variables and Default Values in JavaScript
- Automatic Color fixes for Accessible Contrast Ratios
- Improved Typography and CSS Reset
- Improved User Interaction States
- Improved Accessibility and Keyboard Movement
- Right to left Language Support
- Convenience Configuration and Context Provider Components
- Around 50 new Components and 40 hooks
- All Material Icons Available as Components
- Scoped Packages
- New Documentation Site
