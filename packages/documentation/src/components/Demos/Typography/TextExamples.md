There are 13 different typography styles provided by `react-md` and the material
design specifications. You can use the `Text` component exported from this
package to apply a specific style or use the `rmd-typoraphy` mixin within SCSS
files.

If you want to change the typography styles, check out the
[$rmd-typography-styles documentation](/packages/typography/sassdoc#typography-variable-rmd-typography-styles).
