# DangerouslyRunCode

Note: This is pretty much everything from https://github.com/nihgwu/react-runner/tree/974ebc932db7b7c7d59f1b50a79aed705efbf75a
I just updated it so that it:

- uses the new jsx runtime
- does not require class components
- works correctly with ESM
- works in StrictMode after SSR
