# How to Customize

Customize `react-md` globally by overriding Sass variables and configuration
objects for React components. Additional styles can be changed through the
custom properties along with the Sass API and the `className` props on React
components.

## Recommended Setup

> !Info! Check out the [example projects](/getting-started/example-projects) to
> see completed examples with the recommended setup.

Start by creating a file that `@forward`s everything from `react-md` with all
the global overrides required in the app. This file can also include forward
custom Sass variables, mixins, and functions that will be used throughout the
app.

I recommend naming this file the `_everything.scss` and will be referenced
throughout the documentation website.

### `_everything.scss`

The example below show just forwards the default theme variables again to show
an example structure.

```scss fileName="_everything.scss"
@use "@react-md/core/a11y";
@use "@react-md/core/colors";
@use "sass:color";

@forward "@react-md/core" with (
  $color-scheme: light,
  $primary-color: colors.$blue-500,
  $secondary-color: colors.$orange-a-400,
  $warning-color: colors.$deep-orange-a-400,
  $error-color: colors.$red-500,
  $success-color: colors.$green-a-700,
  $light-theme-background-color: #fafafa,
  $light-theme-surface-color: colors.$white,
  $light-theme-text-primary-color: color.adjust(colors.$black, $lightness: 13%),
  $light-theme-text-secondary-color: color.adjust(
      colors.$black,
      $lightness: 46%
    ),
  $light-theme-text-hint-color: color.adjust(colors.$black, $lightness: 66%),
  $light-theme-text-disabled-color: color.adjust(colors.$black, $lightness: 62%),
  $dark-theme-background-color: #121212,
  $dark-theme-surface-color: #424242,
  $dark-theme-text-primary-color: color.adjust(colors.$white, $lightness: -15%),
  $dark-theme-text-secondary-color: color.adjust(
      colors.$white,
      $lightness: -30%
    ),
  $dark-theme-text-hint-color: color.adjust(colors.$white, $lightness: -50%),
  $dark-theme-text-disabled-color: color.adjust(colors.$white, $lightness: -50%)
);
```

Now that this file has been created, it can be imported in any other Sass file
to reuse the customizations and have access to the Sass API.

```scss fileName="src/index.scss"
@use "everything";

@include everything.styles;
```

```scss fileName="src/components/SomeComponent.module.scss" compile
@use "everything";

.container {
  @include everything.theme-use-var(background-color);
  @include everything.theme-use-var(color, text-primary-color);
}
```

> !Warn! The Sass configuration might need to be updated to support absolute
> imports for the `_everything.scss`. Use one of the
> [example project](/getting-started/example-projects) as a reference point.

### `rmdConfig.tsx`

Create a root Javascript file that can configure some of the React component behavior
such as:

- setting default icons
- configuring the ripple behavior when clicking elements
- setting the default form theme

See the [global configuration](./global-configuration) for more details around this file.

## Customizing Typography

See the
[customizing typography demo](/components/typography#customizing-typography)
for an interactive example for updating typography.

## Overriding global component `className`

> !Warn! Before overriding global `className`, it is recommended to configure
> variables through the Sass variables API first.

If all else fails, custom styles can be applied manually by inspecting the
elements for different class names and applying them globally. Here's an
example for customizing buttons:

```scss
.rmd-button {
  border: 1px solid red;
  background: orange;
  border-radius: 12px;
}

.rmd-button--text {
  min-width: 100px;
  border-radius: 9001px;
}
```

## One-off styles through the `className` props

All components support overriding styles through the `className` prop. The
`className` is almost always applied to the top-most element and additional
`partProps` or `partClassName` props are exposed to style the other elements
in the component.

For example, the [Avatar component](/components/avatar) can be styled using the
`className` prop and the child `<img>` can be styled through
`imgProps={{ className: "custom-class-name" }}`. The
[Dialog component](/components/dialog) can be styled through the `className` and the
`containerProps={{ className: "custom-class-name" }}`.

## Overriding custom properties

Most of the colors, padding, margin, spacing, and borders can be customized
through CSS Custom Properties allowing for dynamic customization for parts of
the app or allowing a user to configure their own theme. It is recommended to
use the [Sass Theme API](./sass-theme-api) to override or use these custom
properties, but they can also be configured manually if needed.

```scss compile
@use "everything";

.example {
  @include everything.theme-use-var(background-color);
  @include everything.theme-use-var(color, text-primary-color);
  @include everything.theme-set-var(error-color, red);
  @include everything.button-set-var(border-radius, 3px);
}
```
