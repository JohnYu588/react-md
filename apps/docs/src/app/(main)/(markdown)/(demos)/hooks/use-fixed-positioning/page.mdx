# useFixedPositioning [$SOURCE](packages/core/src/positioning/useFixedPositioning.ts)

```ts disableTransform
function useFixedPositioning<
  FixedToElement extends HTMLElement,
  FixedElement extends HTMLElement,
>(
  options: FixedPositioningOptions<FixedToElement, FixedElement>
): FixedPositioningImplementation<FixedElement>;
```

The `useFixedPositioning` hooks is used to attach a temporary (fixed) element
to another element within the page. In other words, this is a way to have an
element with `position: fixed` as if it were `position: absolute` to a parent
element that had `position: relative`.

## Example Usage

The `useFixedPositioning` hook should generally be used with the
`useCSStransition` component as it provides `transitionOptions` for that hook
to be able to render correctly.

```demo source="./SimpleExample.tsx"

```

### Advanced Configuration

The `useFixedPositioning` supports a lot of positioning behavior such as:

- anchoring at specific points on the fixed to element
- modifying the spacing between the fixed to and fixed element
- listening to resize events
- listening to scroll events and determining if the fixed to and fixed element
  are no longer in the viewport
- merging transition callbacks, styles, refs, etc
- setting the width for the fixed element to be equal to the fixed to element
  or at least the min width of the fixed to element
- prevent overlapping the fixed to element
- prevent swapping to the other side to fit within the viewport
- prevent fixing within the viewport
- adding a `transform-origin` based on the position anchor
- setting an `initialX` and `initialY` value to appear from a specific point
- dynamically generating the position options
- and more!

There is a lot of behavior, so this next example is just a playground showcasing
and commenting most of the features allowing you to see how they affect the fixed
element.

## Parameters

- `options` - An object with the following definition:

```ts disableTransform
export interface FixedPositioningOptions<
  FixedToElement extends HTMLElement,
  FixedElement extends HTMLElement,
> extends FixedPositioningTransitionOptions<FixedElement>,
    CalculateFixedPositionOptions {
  /**
   * An optional style that will be merged with the fixed positioning required
   * styles.
   *
   * @see {@link FixedPositionStyle}
   */
  style?: CSSProperties;

  /**
   * A ref pointing to an element that another element should be fixed to. This
   * **must** be provided for the positioning to work.
   */
  fixedTo: RefObject<FixedToElement>;

  /**
   * An optional function that can be used to override positioning options if
   * some options require the element to be in the DOM for specific
   * calculations.
   */
  getFixedPositionOptions?: () => CalculateFixedPositionOptions;

  /**
   * An optional function to call if the page resizes while the `FixedElement`
   * is visible.
   */
  onResize?: EventListener;
  /** @see {@link TransitionScrollCallback} */
  onScroll?: TransitionScrollCallback<FixedToElement, FixedElement>;

  /**
   * Set this to `true` to disable the fixed positioning behavior so it can be
   * customized within CSS or manually instead. This was added mostly to just
   * support rendering menus inline with other content (like autocompletes
   * within a dialog).
   *
   * @defaultValue `false`
   * @since 6.0.0
   */
  disabled?: boolean;

   * element becomes visible.

   * @defaultValue `false`
   */
  preventOverlap?: boolean;

  /**
   * Boolean if the auto-swapping behavior should be disabled. It's normally
   * recommended to not disable this since it'll allow elements to appear off

   */
  disableSwapping?: boolean;

  /**
   * Boolean if the fixed positioning should no longer prevent the fixed element

## Returns

```ts disableTransform

  style: CSSProperties | undefined;

  /**
   * This should really only be used if the {@link transitionOptions} is not
   * being used.
