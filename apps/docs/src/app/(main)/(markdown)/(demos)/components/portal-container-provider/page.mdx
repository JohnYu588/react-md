# Portal Container Provider

The `PortalContainerProvider` can be used to change the default portal location
for the app. This is automatically included in the
[CoreProviders](./core-providers) but can be used anywhere in the app as well.

# Custom Portal Container

If the portal location needs to be changed for `react-md` components for some
reason, wrap that portion of the app in the `PortalContainerProvider` that sets
the specific DOM node to render into.

```demo source="./CustomPortalContainer.tsx"

```
