# Cross Fade

The cross fade transition is generally used for displaying new items with an
enter only transition that fades in while dropping down into place. I don't
remember why I named it cross fade.

The transition can be triggered by using the `CrossFade` component or
`useCrossFadeTransition` hook.

# New Items Example

This example will showcase how the `CrossFade` component can be used to animate
new items that appear within a grid. The `CrossFade` child **must** forward
refs and accept a `className` to animate correctly.

```demo source="./NewItemsExample.tsx"

```

## Incorrect Example

This example will show how to fix common issues with the `CrossFade` component's
child transition.

```demo source="./IncorrectExample.tsx"

```

# Using Keys

The cross fade transition can be triggered by changing the `key` on the
`CrossFade` component.

```demo source="./UsingKeysExample.tsx"

```

# Cross Fade Transition Hook

The `useCrossFadeTransition` can be used instead of the `CrossFade` component to
enable the cross fade transition. The hook will provide `elementProps`
containing a `ref` and `className` which must be passed to a component for the
transition to work.

> !Warn! Unlike the `CrossFade` component, the `useCrossFadeTransition` does
> not default to enabling `appear` transitions.

```demo source="./CrossFadeTransitionHookExample.tsx"

```

## Transition To

The main benefit to the `useCrossFadeTransition` hook is that the transition
can be triggered without re-mounting child components which is ideal for full page
layout transitions. To trigger a new transition, call `transitionTo("enter")`.

> !Info! See the [useCSSTransition hook](/hooks/use-css-transition) for more options.

```demo source="./TransitionToExample.tsx"
