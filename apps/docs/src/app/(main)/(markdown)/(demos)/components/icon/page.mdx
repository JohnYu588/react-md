# Icon

Icons can be used to represent actions and information in a condensed form. They
should normally be accompanied with screenreader accessible text and/or a tooltip.

> !Info! Check out the [material icons and symbols](/components/material-icons-and-symbols)
> page to see all available icons from Material Design via the
> `@react-md/material-icons` package.

## Icon Theme

The icon can use all the different theme colors through the `theme` prop.

```demo source="./IconTheme.tsx"

```

## Icon Size

The icon can be sized as: `normal` (default) or `dense` out of the box. Set `dense` to `true`
to render at a slightly smaller size.

The icon's size will also automatically scale to the current `font-size` when set directly
or can be configured using the [icon-set-var](/sassdoc/icon#mixin-set-var) mixin:

```scss
@use "everything";

.container {
  @include everything.icon-set-var(size, 2rem);
}
```

```demo source="./IconSize.tsx"

```

## Custom Font Icons

The `FontIcon` component can be used to render icons that have been created as web fonts. It
defaults to Material Icons but can be configured by using the `iconClassName` prop.

```demo source="./FontAwesomeExample.tsx"

```

## Custom SVG Icons

Custom SVG icons can be created by using the `SVGIcon` component and pasting the
svg contents as `children`. Here is the `AbcIcon` from Material Icons for
example:

```tsx
import { forwardRef } from "react";
import type { SVGIconProps } from "react-md";
import { SVGIcon } from "react-md";

export default forwardRef<SVGSVGElement, SVGIconProps>(
  function AbcIcon(props, ref) {
    return (
      <SVGIcon {...props} ref={ref}>
        <path d="M21 11h-1.5v-.5h-2v3h2V13H21v1c0 .55-.45 1-1 1h-3c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1v-4c0-.55.45-1 1-1h3c.55 0 1 .45 1 1v1zM8 10v5H6.5v-1.5h-2V15H3v-5c0-.55.45-1 1-1h3c.55 0 1 .45 1 1zm-1.5.5h-2V12h2v-1.5zm7 1.5c.55 0 1 .45 1 1v1c0 .55-.45 1-1 1h-4V9h4c.55 0 1 .45 1 1v1c0 .55-.45 1-1 1zM11 10.5v.75h2v-.75h-2zm2 2.25h-2v.75h2v-.75z" />
      </SVGIcon>
    );
  }
);
```

### Creating Icons Programmatically

Since icons might have specific branding for the company and provided as svgs
from designers, they could also be created by running a script. The steps would
normally be:

- Download the raw `.svg`s that has been exported from some design program
- Move the raw `.svg`s into a common folder that can be part of source control
- Run the `.svg` through [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to minify and
  optimize the icon
- Extract the svg contents to create an icon component

Here is an example that could be used but will need to be modified depending on
the svg exports.

```demo source="./createIcons.ts" importOnly

```
