# Button

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

- Dialogs
- Modal windows
- Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

# Simple Button

The `Button` comes in multiple theme types: `flat` (default), `outlined`, `contained`

```demo source="./SimpleButton.tsx"

```

## Text Button

[Text buttons](https://m2.material.io/components/buttons#text-button) are typically used for less-pronounced actions, including those located:

- In Dialogs
- In Cards

In cards, text buttons help maintain an emphasis on card content.

```demo source="./TextButton.tsx"

```

## Outlined Button

[Outlined buttons](https://m2.material.io/components/buttons#outlined-button) are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important, but arenâ€™t the primary action in an app.

```demo source="./OutlinedButton.tsx"

```

## Contained Button

[Contained buttons](https://m2.material.io/components/buttons#contained-button) Contained buttons are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill. They contain actions that are primary to your app.

```demo source="./ContainedButton.tsx"

```

# Themed Button

The `Button` can also be themed with different theme colors:

- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `warning`
- `success`
- `error`
- `disabled`
- `clear` (default)

The `theme` will be applied as the text color for `flat` buttons, as the text color and border color
for `outlined` buttons, and the background color for `contained` buttons.

```demo source="./ThemedButton.tsx"

```

# Icon Button

An icon button can be used when space is limited like on mobile devices or when
there are a lot of actions. Icon buttons support all the same theme behavior as
text buttons and can be rendered as a circle (default) or as a square.

To create an icon button, set the `buttonType` prop to `"icon"` or `"icon-square"`.

> !Warn! Icon buttons **must** provide accessible text for screen readers through `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, or [SrOnly](/components/sr-only) text.

```demo source="./IconButton.tsx"

```

## Icon Sizes

The icon button's size can be easily changed by updating the `font-size` to a
new value which will automatically scale the padding with it. There are a few
sizes by default: `small`, `normal` (default), and `large`.

> !Warn! Using small icon buttons will be less accessible since there is a
> smaller touch target.

```demo source="./IconButtonSizes.tsx"

```

# Button with Text and Icon

Text and icons can both exist within a `Button` by just including them in the `children`. Each element
rendered in a button will automatically be separated using `gap` set to the `$icon-spacing` amount.

> !Info! An `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, or `SrOnly` text is **not** needed for each icon in this sort of button since it is only presentational.

```demo source="./ButtonWithTextAndIcon.tsx"

```

## Responsive Button

A common pattern is to have a button be icon only on phones due to the limited screen size
and then include a label as well once there is enough space. This can be done by enabling
the `responsive` prop on the button and wrapping the label in the [SrOnly](/components/sr-only)
component with the `phoneOnly` prop enabled:

```demo source="./ResponsiveButton.tsx"

```

# Floating Action Button

[Floating action buttons](https://m2.material.io/components/buttons-floating-action-button#usage)
performs the primary, or most common, action on a screen. It appears in front
of all screen content, typically as a circular shape with an icon in its
center.

To create a floating action button, set the `floating` prop to one of:
`top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, or `bottom-right` while will position
the button in that location within the screen by using `position: fixed`. When
the floating prop is defined, the button default props will be updated with
`theme="secondary"`, `themeType="contained"`, and `buttonType="icon"`.

```demo source="./FloatingActionButton.tsx" card phone

```

# Async Button

The `AsyncButton` can be used to display a loading indicator inside a button
while an async task completes. If the `onClick` handler is an async function,
the loading indicator will display until the promise resolves.

```demo source="./AsyncButtonPromise.tsx"

```

## Manual Pending State

When the pending state is derived by a separate action, the loading indicator
can be shown by setting the `loading` prop to `true`:

```demo source="./ManualPendingState.tsx"

```

## Loading Indicator Types

The `AsyncButton` supports the following loading indicator behaviors out of the box:

- `circular-overlay` (**default**) - Renders a circular loading indicator above the
  `children` and hides the rest of the content in the button
- `circular-before` - renders a circular loading indicator before the `children`
- `circular-after` - renders a circular loading indicator after the `children`
- `linear-above` - Renders a linear loading indicator above the `children`
- `linear-below` - Renders a linear loading indicator below the `children`

```demo source="./LoadingIndicatorTypes.tsx"

```

## Custom Loading Children

If the `children` should be swapped out along with the loading indicator,
provide that content through the `loadingChildren` prop.

```demo source="./CustomLoadingChildren.tsx"

```
