# Tabs

Tabs organize content across different screens, data sets, and other
interactions.

# Simple Example

Tabs can be created by using the following components and hooks:

- `useTabs` - Manages the state for the active tab content and provides
  additional accessibility props required for a tab widget
- `TabList` - Contains all the `Tab` components
- `Tab - A button that should show specific content while active
- `SliderContainer`/`Slide` - Used to animate the active tab content into view

```demo source="./SimpleExample.tsx"

```

## With Icons

The `Tab` component can also render an icon to the left, right, above, or below
the content by using the `icon`, `iconAfter`, and `stacked` props.

```demo source="./WithIconsExample.tsx"

```

# Controlling the Active Tab

If the active tab index needs to be controlled externally, the `activeTab` and
`setActiveTab` returned values can be used.

```demo source="./ControllingTheActiveTabExample.tsx"

```

## Custom Active Tab Index

For more complex flows, the `activeTab` can be controlled by providing the
`activeTab` and `setActiveTab` options to the `useTabs` hook.

```demo source="./CustomActiveTabIndexExample.tsx"

```

## Custom Active Tab

If the active tab should be derived from a string value instead of an index, an
ordered list of available tab values need to be provided to the hook so the
keyboard movement behavior can work correctly.

```demo source="./CustomActiveTabExample.tsx"

```

# Link Tab Example

Tabs can also be rendered as links by setting the `as` prop to `"a"` or a custom
link component.

This example shows how the active tab could be derived from the current
`window.location.hash`, but most real world examples would be based on
`pathname` or search parameters.

```demo source="./LinkTabExample.tsx"

```

# Scrollable Tabs

When there are overflow issues due to rendering a lot of tabs, the overflown
tabs will be hidden by default. The user can scroll the hidden tabs into view
by hovering the `TabList` and either:

- `Shift + Mouse Wheel` on Windows
- Two-finger scroll on Mac
- Touch scroll on touch devices
- [Keyboard behavior](#keyboard-movement)

Since most users might not know how to scroll horizontally, scroll buttons can
be enabled instead that will scroll 1/10th the distance on each click.

```demo source="./ScrollableTabsExample.tsx"

```

## Scrollable Tabs with Scrollbar

A scrollbar could also be shown with or without the scroll buttons by enabling
the `scrollbar` prop.

```demo source="./ScrollableTabsWithScrollbarExample.tsx"

```

## Custom Scroll Behavior

The scroll distance can be configured by providing the `getScrollToOptions` to
the `TabList` component.

```demo source="./CustomScrollBehaviorExample.tsx"

```

# Vertical Tabs

Tabs can be rendered vertically instead of horizontally by enabling the
`vertical` prop on the `TabList` component.

```demo source="./VerticalTabsExample.tsx"

```

# Disable Active Tab Transition

The active tab indicator transition can be disabled by setting
`disableTransition` to `true` on the `TabList` component and enabling the
`activeIndicator` prop on each `Tab`.

```demo source="./DisableActiveTabTransitionExample.tsx"

```

## Disable Vertical Active Tab Transition

If the tabs are rendered vertically, the `verticalActiveIndicator` prop must
also be enabled on each `Tab` for the correct styles to apply.

```demo source="./DisableVerticalActiveTabTransitionExample.tsx"

```

# Custom Tab Panels

The `SlideContainer` and `Slide` components are not required for rendering the
different tab panels, but it will make it easier to use since most of the
required functionality has already been defined.

> !Info! Check out the [Slide demos](/components/slide) to see how to disable
> the transition or temporarily render each tab panel instead of hiding with
> `display: none`.

Here is a small example for creating custom tab panels without the
`SlideContainer` and `Slide` components.

```demo source="./CustomTabPanelsExample.tsx"

```

# Accessibility

The tab components and hooks implement the
[tabs pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/).

## Keyboard Movement

- Using `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` will only focus the active tab
- Once a tab has been focused, `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight` can be used to
  focus another tab
  - Use `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown` for vertical tabs
- Pressing `Enter` or `Space` will select the focused tab
- `Home` - Move focus to the first tab
- `End` - Move focus to the last tab

## Activation Mode

When navigating between tabs with a keyboard, tabs must be activated manually by
pressing `Space` or `Enter`. An alternative approach is to automatically select
a tab once focused with a keyboard by setting `activationMode="automatic"`.

```demo source="./ActivationModeExample.tsx"

```
