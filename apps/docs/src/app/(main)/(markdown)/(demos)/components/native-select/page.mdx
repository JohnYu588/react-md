# Native Select

The `NativeSelect` component is just a wrapper around the `<select>` element to
apply some of the default theme styles. If additional customization that is not
supported by the browser is required, use the [Select](/components/select)
instead.

# Simple Native Select

```demo source="./SimpleNativeSelect.tsx"

```

## Native Select Theme

The `NativeSelect` supports the different form themes:

- `"outline"` (default) - Applies an outline mimicking a native text box
- `"underline"` - Only applies an underline that will grow from the left,
  center, or right
- `"filled"` - An extension of the `"underline"` that also adds a background
  color to make it appear clickable
- `"none"` - no styling. This is useful if a custom theme should be applied

> !Info! The default theme can be configured by the [form config](/customization/form-config).

```demo source="./NativeSelectTheme.tsx"

```

# Required Native Select

Making a `<select>` required in a form is a bit tricky. It must:

- have a `name`
- set `required`
- create an `<option>` that has a value of an empty string
- set the `defaultValue` to an empty string

```demo source="./RequiredNativeSelect.tsx"

```

## Required with a placeholder

This example shows how to make a required select that has placeholder text.

```demo source="./RequiredWithAPlaceholder.tsx"

```

# Help and Error Text

The `NativeSelect` component is wrapped in the
[FormMessageContainer](/components/form-message#form-message-container) so additional
hint or error messages can be displayed.

```demo source="./HelpAndErrorText.tsx"

```

# Multiselect Example

```demo source="./MultiselectExample.tsx"

```
