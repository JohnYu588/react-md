# Theme Provider

The `ThemeProvider` can be used get access to the current theme colors in
react components. The main use-case for this is if you are mixing css-in-js
into the app or allowing the user to configure their own theme.

# Derived Theme Example

If the user can configure their own theme, mount the `ThemeProvider` near
the root of the app. The theme will automatically update as the user changes between
light and dark theme.

```demo source="./DerivedThemeExample.tsx"

```

# Known Theme Example

If the theme is static and is just used for css-in-js, provide the `theme` prop.

```demo source="./KnownThemeExample.tsx"

```
