# User Interaction Mode Provider

The `UserInteractionModeProvider` is used to determine if the user is
interacting with the app via `mouse`, `keyboard`, or `touch`. This is mostly an
internal context provider to enable the keyboard movement behavior, tooltips,
menus, sliders, and draggable elements.

> !Info! This is included in the [CoreProviders](./core-providers) and should
> normally be used instead.

> !Error! Only once instance of the `UserInteractionModeProvider` can be
> mounted in the app or else an error will be thrown.

# Detecting User Interaction Mode

Once the provider has been initialized, the interaction mode can be determined
by using the `useUserInteractionMode` hook.
