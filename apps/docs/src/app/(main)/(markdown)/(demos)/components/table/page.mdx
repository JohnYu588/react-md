# Table

Tables display sets of data across rows and columns.

# Simple Example

A table can be created using the following components:

- `Table` - A styled `<table>`
- `TableHeader` - A styled `<thead>`
- `TableBody` - A `<tbody>` with some additional behavior defined later
- `TableFooter` - A styled `<tfoot>` with some additional behavior defined later
- `TableRow` - A styled `<tr>` with some additional behavior defined later
- `TableCell` - A styled `th` or `td`. Rendered as a `th` when a child of the
  `TableHeader` and a `td` otherwise.

The `TableRow` will default to rendering a border on the bottom and a different
background color while hovered when in the `TableBody`.

A [caption](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption)
can be added by using the `Typography` component.

```demo source="./SimpleTableExample.tsx"

```

## Disable Hover Styles

The row hover styles that appear on all the `TableRow` in the `TableBody` can be
configured on the `Table`, `TableBody`, or `TableRow`components with
the`disableHover`prop. The `TableRow` will inherit this value or override the
inherited value if defined.

```demo source="./DisableHoverExample.tsx"

```

## Disable Border Styles

The bottom border that appears on all `TableRow` in the `TableBody` can be
removed by enabling the `disableBorders` prop on the `Table`, `TableBody`, or
`TableRow` components. The `TableRow` will inherit this value or override the
inherited value if defined.

```demo source="./DisableBordersExample.tsx"

```

# Scrollable Tables

If a table should be scrollable, wrap it in a `TableContainer`. The
`TableContainer` allows scrolling horizontally and vertically by adding:

```css
.rmd-table-container {
  max-width: 100%;
  overflow: auto;
}
```

```demo source="./ScrollableTableExample.tsx"

```

# Selectable Rows

A common pattern with tables are to make the rows selectable so different
actions can be applied. A `TableRow` can be updated to have a `selected` state
which will add a different background color and a `clickable` state that updates
the cursor to be a pointer.

```demo source="./SelectableRowsExample.tsx"

```

## Selectable Rows with Checkbox

It is recommended to use the `TableCheckbox` component as the first cell in each
row to help show the row can be selected and the
[useCheckboxGroup](/hooks/use-checkbox-group) hook to control the selected
state.

```demo source="./SelectableRowsWithCheckboxExample.tsx"

```

## Selectable Rows with Radio

If only one row can be selected at a time, the `TableRadio` component can be
used instead.

```demo source="./SelectableRowsWithRadioExample.tsx"

```

## Updating Selected Row Color

The selected background color defaults to
`core.interaction-get-var(selected-background-color)`. This can be configured by
the `core.$table-row-selected-color` Sass variable or the
`--rmd-table-selected-background-color` custom property.

If the text color and hover colors also need to change while selected, it is
recommended to just add a custom `className` while selected instead. Here's a
quick example of using the primary color while selected.

```demo source="./UpdatingSelectedRowColorExample.tsx"

```

# Sortable Columns

To create a sortable header cell, provide the `aria-sort` prop to a `TableCell`
as one of the following values:

- `"ascending"` - The data has been sorted in ascending order. So A-z, 0-9, and
  earlier dates before later dates.
- `"descending"` The data has been sorted in descending order. So z-A, 9-0, and
  later dates before earlier dates.
- `"other"` - The data has been sorted in another programmatic order.
- `"none"` - The data has not been sorted ("aria-sort" default)

When the `aria-sort` prop has been set to one of these values, the cell will
automatically update the children to be rendered within a button element so that
it can be tab-focused and clickable for keyboard users. However when the sort
behavior has been set to `none`, only the button element will be rendered
without the current sort icon to show that it is not currently sorted, but can
be.

```demo source="./SortableColumnsExample.tsx"

```

## Customizing Sort Icon

The sortable `TableCell` component will use the
[sort](/customization/icon-config#sort) icon from the `ICON_CONFIG` by default
but can also be configured by providing the `sortIcon` prop.

The sort icon can also be placed after the children by enabling the
`sortIconAfter` prop and disable the rotation transition by enabling
`disableTransition` to the `iconRotatorProps`.

```demo source="./CustomizingSortIconExample.tsx"

```

# Sticky Tables

Tables within `react-md` can be updated to have sticky headers, footers, and
columns by using
[sticky positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#sticky_positioning).
When an element has `position: sticky` set, it will be fixed within the
**closest scroll container** based on the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`
properties. If there are no parent elements that have `overflow: auto` or
`overflow: scroll`, the sticky elements can be positioned relative to the
entire document.

## Container Based Sticky Table

To create a sticky `TableHeader` or `TableFooter`, enable the `sticky` prop
which will add `top: 0` and `bottom: 0` as the sticky positioning. This will
make it so the header and footer are stuck to the top and bottom of the
`TableContainer` component.

```demo source="./ContainerBasedStickyTableExample.tsx"

```

## Viewport Based Sticky Table

To create a sticky `TableHeader` and `TableFooter` relative to the viewport, do
not wrap the `Table` with the `TableContainer` and ensure no parent elements
have `overflow: auto` set. If there is a fixed header in the app, the header
will also need to update it's position so it is stuck below that header. This
can be done by updating the `--rmd-table-sticky-header` custom property or
setting the `top` style.

```demo source="./ViewportBasedStickyTableExample.tsx"

```

## Sticky Columns Example

A column of `TableCell` can also become sticky horizontally by enabling the
`sticky` prop on each `TableCell` in that column. It defaults to using `left: 0`
(`right: 0` when RTL) but can be configured by the `--rmd-table-sticky-cell`
custom property.

This example will showcase a sticky checkbox cell followed by a sticky row
header cell with sticky headers and footers.

```demo source="./StickyColumnsExample.tsx"

```

## Sticky Active Styles

When the `TableHeader`/`TableFooter` have the `sticky` prop enabled, some magic
happens behind the scenes to automatically raise the elevation for the
`TableHeader`/`TableFooter` when covering rows of content by scroll position.
These styles can be configured globally by the
`core.$table-sticky-header-inactive-styles`,
`core.$table-sticky-header-active-styles`,
`core.$table-sticky-footer-inactive-styles`, and
`core.$table-sticky-footer-active-styles` Sass variables.

If the styles should not be configured globally, provide a custom
`stickyActiveClassName` and optionally `className` to override the styling.

```demo source="./StickyActiveStylesExample.tsx"

```

## Disable Sticky Active Styles

The sticky active styles can also be disabled by enabling the
`disableStickyStyles`.

```demo source="./DisableStickyActiveStylesExample.tsx"

```
