# Text Field

[Text fields](https://m2.material.io/components/text-fields#usage) allow users
to enter text into a UI. They typically appear in forms and dialogs.

# Simple Text Field

The default text field will look similar to a native `<input type="text">`
with a border surrounding the text content that will change color and thickness
when hovered or focused. Every text field should have an accessible label by
providing one of the following props: `label`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`.

It is generally recommended to
[place a label with the text field](https://m2.material.io/components/text-fields#research),
but placeholder only text fields are also supported.

```demo source="./OutlinedTextField.tsx"

```

## Filled Text Field

Filled text fields have more visual emphasis than outlined text fields, making
them stand out when surrounded by other content and components.

```demo source="./FilledTextField.tsx"

```

## Underlined Text Field

Underlined text fields have the least emphasis, making them better for less
prominent editing.

```demo source="./UnderlinedTextField.tsx"

```

## No Theme Text Field

The text field can also be set with `theme="none"` which removes most of the
styling behavior. There isn't much use for this though since the floating label
will not display correctly when this is set and can only be used for placeholder
only text fields.

```demo source="./NoThemeTextField.tsx"

```

# Text Field State

The text field supports the following states:

- `disabled` - Greys out the input and prevents modifications
- `readOnly` - Normal styles but prevents modifications
- `error` - Applies the theme error color (normally red)
- `active` - Applies the focus state if it is required to be manually be
  triggered

```demo source="./TextFieldState.tsx"

```

# Text Field Type

The text field supports rendering as most of the [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types)
that are displayed as a textbox. There is no additional functionality built-in
to support these types other than attempting to display them correctly.

```demo source="./TextFieldType.tsx"

```

## Password

When rendering password fields, it is recommended to use the `Password`
component instead which will allow the user to toggle the visibility of the
password.

```demo source="./PasswordExample.tsx"

```

## Number

The default browser implementation `<input type="number">` leaves much to be
desired so a `useNumberField` hook is provided to fix the following issues and
additional type safety.

- the value will only be `undefined` if the `defaultValue` provided was
  `undefined`
- displays an error message when the user types an invalid number. These are
  _technically_ valid numbers in the browser implementation: `--0`, `0-0`,
  `0-0-`, `++0`, etc
- attempts to fix the number on blur:
  - `00000` -> `0`
  - `001` -> `1`
  - `1e+3` -> `1000`
  - enforce the value between the `min` and `max` values (if provided)

See more info at the [useNumberField documentation](/hooks/use-number-field).

```demo source="./NumberExample.tsx"

```

# Simple TextArea

Use the `TextArea` component when multiple lines of text should be supported. It
supports all the same theming, addons, help text, and error text as the
`TextField` but renders in a `<textarea>` instead.

The default behavior of the `TextArea` is to resize it's height based on the
current amount of text.

```demo source="./SimpleTextArea.tsx"

```

## Setting Max Rows

Since it might not be ideal to support an infinite editing height, the max
number of rows to grow to can be specified by the `maxRows` prop.

```demo source="./ResizingTextAreaMaxRows.tsx"

```

## Disabling Resize Transition

The textarea's height transition can be disabled by setting `disableTransition`.

```demo source="./DisablingResizeTransition.tsx"

```

## Other Resize Behavior

The native [resize behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea#controlling_whether_a_textarea_is_resizable)
is also supported by setting the `resize` prop to one of: `horizontal`,
`vertical`, `both`, or `none`.

```demo source="./OtherResizeBehavior.tsx"

```

# Text Field Addon

The `TextField` can render addons (normally icons) before and after the text of
by using the `leftAddon`/`rightAddon` props. The addon will be placed above the
`<input>` using absolute positioning and the `<input>` will gain additional
`padding-left`/`padding-right` so the addons will not overlap with the text
content.

```demo source="./TextFieldAddon.tsx"

```

## Non-icon Addons

If an addon is not icon sized, additional styling will be required. Here are a
few available options:

1. Modify the `--rmd-text-field-padding-left`/`--rmd-text-field-padding-right` to
   be the width of the addon plus some additional padding. This is the "best"
   option if the addons should still be rendered above the `<input>` element
   since it will also update the floating label position automatically
   - See the [Automatic Addon Padding](#automatic-addon-padding) example to see
     how this can be handled automatically.
2. Set `disableLeftAddonStyles`/`disableRightAddonStyles` to `true` to no longer
   use absolute positioning and render the addon inline
3. Add custom styles with `leftAddonProps`/`rightAddonProps` as needed

```demo source="./NonIconAddons.tsx"

```

## Automatic Addon Padding

If the addons are dynamic or custom styles are not desired, the
`useTextFieldContainerAddons` hook can be used to automatically update the
`--rmd-text-field-padding-left`/`--rmd-text-field-padding-right` variables using
the [useResizeObserver](/hooks/use-resize-observer) behind the scenes.

The `useTextFieldContainerAddons` hook requires a `leftAddon` and `rightAddon`
flag to be provided and will return a `style` object, `leftAddonRef`, and
`rightAddonRef` which can be passed to the `TextField` component.

```demo source="./AutomaticAddonPaddingExample.tsx"

```

# Help Text and Error Text

The `TextField` component is wrapped in the
[FormMessageContainer](/components/form-message#form-message-container) so additional
hint or error messages can be displayed.

```demo source="./HelpTextAndErrorText.tsx"

```

## Text Field With Counter

A text field can also render an inline counter using the `messageProps` by
providing the current length of the value and a `maxLength`.

```demo source="./TextFieldWithCounter.tsx"

```

## Text Field Hook

The `useTextField` hook can be used to control the value of a single text field
to conditionally display help text, error text, error icons, and inline
counters. The hook also supports simple validation using the
[Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation).

Check out the [useTextField documentation](/hooks/use-text-field) for more
information.

```demo source="./TextFieldHookExample.tsx"

```
