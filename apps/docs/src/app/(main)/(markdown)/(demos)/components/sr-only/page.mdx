# Sr Only

The `SrOnly` component can be used to render accessible labels that are only
visible to screen readers by default.

# Simple Example

The most common usage for the `SrOnly` component is to add text to an icon
button when a label cannot be provided by the `aria-label`.

> queries.

```demo source="./SimpleExample.tsx"

```

## Visible while Focused

The text can also become visible while focused if needed by enabling the
`focusable` prop. Tab into the next demo to see the text.
