# Slide

The slide transition is usually used for creating a [carousel](./carousel) which
animates different panels into view horizontally.

# Simple Example

The slide transition can be created by using a `SlideContainer` and `Slide`
components. The `SlideContainer` requires the transition `direction` prop and
each `Slide` requires an `active` state to trigger the transition.

```demo source="./SimpleExample.tsx" disablePadding

```

## Vertical

The slide transition can also be vertical instead of horizontal by enabling the `vertical` prop.

```demo source="./VerticalExample.tsx" disablePadding

```

# Preventing Layout Shifts

When the `Slide` content have different heights, the layout might shift when
the animation completes to match the current content's height. If this
behavior isn't desired, check out the
[useMaxTabPanelHeight](/hooks/use-max-tab-panel-height) hook and
[Use Max Tab Panel Height demo](/components/tabs#use-max-tab-panel-height).
