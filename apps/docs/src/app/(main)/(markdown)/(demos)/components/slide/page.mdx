# Slide

The slide transition is usually used for creating a [carousel](./carousel) which
animates different panels into view horizontally.

# Simple Example

The slide transition can be created by using a `SlideContainer` and `Slide`
components. The `SlideContainer` requires the transition `direction` prop and
each `Slide` requires an `active` state to trigger the transition.
