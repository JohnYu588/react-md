# Responsive Item

The `ResponsiveItem` component can be used to make images, videos, iframes, or
other media elements responsive within a relative container with built-in
support for forcing specific aspect ratios when the item's size is unknown.

> !Info! See the [objectFit](/utils/object-fit) class name utility function
> for a simpler implementation.

# Simple Example

This example will show how to create responsive images by wrapping the
`<img>` element in the `ResponsiveItem`. The default behavior
will be to respect the `<img>` dimensions but scale them down into the
container's width.

Try resizing the browser or updating the `columns` constant in the next
demo to see how it works.

```demo source="./SimpleExample.tsx"

```

# Force Aspect Ratio

When dealing with unknown content, the aspect ratio can be forced using
the `aspectRatio` prop. The default aspect ratios are:
`16-9`, `4-3`, and `1-1`.

```demo source="./ForceAspectRatio.tsx"

```

## YouTube IFrame Example

When a YouTube video should be rendered in an iframe, either the `height` and
`width` need to be provided to the `iframe` or an aspect ratio must be set on
the `ResponsiveItem` to work correctly.

```demo source="./YouTubeIFrame.tsx"

```

## Configuring Allowed Aspect Ratios

The generated aspect ratios are configured by the
[$SASSDOC](responsive-item-aspect-ratios) Sass variable which is a map of
`x-y: x y`.

```demo source="./ConfiguringAllowedAspectRatios.tsx"

```

# Responsive Item Overlay Example

It can sometimes be useful to add an overlay above the responsive item to cover
it with a title, description, or other information. Use the `ResponsiveItemOverlay`
component to add this overlayh within a `ResponsiveItem`.

```demo source="./ResponsiveItemOverlayExample.tsx"

```

## Overlay Positions

The `ResponsiveItemOverlay` supports the following positions:

- `top`
- `right`
- `bottom` (default)
- `left`
- `middle` - vertically centered
- `center` - horizontally centered
- `absolute-center` - horizontally and vertically centered

```demo source="./OverlayPositions.tsx"

```

## Customizing Styles

The global overlay styles can be configured by changing the following sass variables:

- [$SASSDOC](responsive-item-overlay-background-color)
- [$SASSDOC](responsive-item-overlay-color)
- [$SASSDOC](responsive-item-overlay-z-index)
- [$SASSDOC](responsive-item-overlay-padding)
- [$SASSDOC](responsive-item-overlay-horizontal-width)

Otherwise, custom styles can be provided using the `className` prop like normal.

```demo source="./CustomizingStyles.tsx"

```
