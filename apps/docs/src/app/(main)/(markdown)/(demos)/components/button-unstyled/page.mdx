# Button Unstyled

This component won't really be used much externally, but it is used
internally for [sortable table columns](./table#sortable-columns)
and [expansion panels](./expansion-panel).

# Simple Example

The `ButtonUnstyled` component is a simple
`<button type="button" className="rmd-button-unstyled">` wrapper that removes
the browser's button default border and background styles and adds some
reasonable defaults. The typography is inherited by the parent element and
normally needs to be defined.
