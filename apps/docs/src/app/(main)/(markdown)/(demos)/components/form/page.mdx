# Form

The `Form` component is an unstyled utility component to just prevent default
behavior when the submit event is fired.

# Simple Example

This example just shows that all the default `<form>` behavior works the same other
than preventing the full form submission.

> !Info! If you want to allow the submit behavior, the `disablePreventDefault`
> prop can be enabled. It's just better to use a normal `<form>` at that point.
