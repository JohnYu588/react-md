# Autocomplete

An `AutoComplete` is a component that allows for real-time suggestions from a
pre-determined list as the user types by filtering data based on the current
value. It can also be used to interact with an API that handles the sorting,
filtering, matching, etc as well.

# Simple Example

An `Autocomplete` requires a list of options which can be strings or an object
with a `label` string so that the options can be filtered as the user types.

```demo source="./SimpleExample.tsx"

```

## Simple Label Example

This is the same example as above, but using options as `{ label: string }`.

```demo source="./SimpleLabelExample.tsx"

```

# Object Options

The `Autocomplete` can support any object option by also providing an
`extractor` prop that will return a string value for each option.

```demo source="./ObjectOptionsExample.tsx"

```

## Option Props

The `Autocomplete` will automatically pass through common `MenuItem` props that
exist on each option.

```demo source="./OptionPropsExample.tsx"

```

## Get Option Props

Another way to pass props to each option is using the `getOptionProps` function.

```demo source="./GetOptionPropsExample.tsx"

```

# Disabled Options

An option can be disabled by adding `disabled: true` to the option or using `getOptionProps`
to return `disabled: true`.

```demo source="./DisabledOptionsExample.tsx"

```

# Selected Value Example

The current selected option can be tracked using the `onAutocomplete` prop which is called whenever
a new option is selected or the value is reset. When the value is reset, this
will be called with `null`.

```demo source="./SelectedValueExample.tsx"

```

# Custom Filter Function

The `Autocomplete` uses the [caseInsensitiveSearch](/utils/case-insensitive-search) filter function by default
but can be changed using the `filter` prop. The filter function must return the
filtered list and is called with an object containing:

- `list` - The list of `options` to filter
- `query` - The current text field value
- `extractor` - The `extractor` function to get a string for each option
- `whitespace` - Either `"ignore"`, `"trim"` (default), or `"keep"` and used by the default search functions

This example will show how the filter function could be swapped out for the [fuzzySearch](/utils/fuzzy-search).

```demo source="./CustomFilterFunctionExample.tsx"

```

## Disable Filtering

When the `value` needs to be controlled or options are already filtered, enable the `disableFilter`
prop.

```demo source="./DisableFilteringExample.tsx"

```

# Async Example

The `Autocomplete` supports rendering a `CircularProgress` after the input field to show
async behavior. The `CircularProgress` will be shown while the `loading` prop is true.

This example below will "load" the options each time the autocomplete is opened.

```demo source="./AsyncExample.tsx"

```

# Accessibility

The `Autocomplete` component implements the
[combobox](https:://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_focus_activedescendant)
so the `<input />` will remain focused while the options gain styles to show
they are focused.

### Closed Listbox

- Typing will open the listbox and keep focus on the input.
- `ArrowDown` - Opens the listbox and focuses the first option.
- `Alt+ArrowDown` - Opens the listbox and keeps focus on the input.
- `ArrowUp` - Opens the listbox and focuses the last option.
- `Escape` - Clears the value.

### Open Listbox

- Typing will move focus back to the input
- `ArrowDown` - Moves focus to the next option in the listbox. If focus was on
  the input, the first option will be focused.
- `ArrowUp` - Moves focus to the previous option in the listbox. If focus was on
  the input, the last option will be focused.
- `Alt+ArrowUp` - If an option is focused, moves focus into the input. If the
  input is focused, closes the listbox.
- `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight`/`Home`/`End` - Moves focus into the input and uses
  default text editing behavior for these keys.
- `Escape` - Hides the listbox.
