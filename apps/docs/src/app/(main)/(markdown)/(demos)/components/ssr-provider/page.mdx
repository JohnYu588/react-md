# SSR Provider

The `SsrProvider` should be used when using server side rendering to help
rehydrate the DOM and should be mounted near the root of the app.

> !Info! This is included in the [CoreProviders](./core-providers) and should
> normally be used instead.

# Enable SSR Mode

```tsx
import { SsrProvider } from "@react-md/core/SsrProvider";

import { RestOfTheApp } from "./RestOfTheApp.jsx";

function App() {
  return (
    <SsrProvider ssr>
      <RestOfTheApp />
    </SsrProvider>
  );
}
```

# Check for SSR

The main purpose for this hook is to be able to determine if the DOM exists
while initializing state or if it needs to be deferred with `useEffect` or
another mechanism. The current state can be retrieved using the `useSsr` hook
and all components that use the `useSsr` hook will be re-rendered once the DOM
has finished rehydrating.

> !Info! This documentation site uses `ssr` mode with [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

This example below will behave differently depending on the flow:

- When reloading this page:
  - Display `Hello`
  - Display `HelloWorld!`
- When resetting the demo or navigating through html5 history
  - Display `World!`

The `ssr` value will never be `true` after initial rehydration.
