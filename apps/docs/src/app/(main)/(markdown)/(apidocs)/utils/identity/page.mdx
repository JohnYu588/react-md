# identity [$SOURCE](packages/core/src/utils/identity.ts)

```ts disableTransform
const identity = <T>(thing: T): T => thing;

import { identity } from "@react-md/core/utils/identity";

interface Props {
  sort: <T>(items: readonly T[]) => readonly T[];
}

function Example(props: Props) {
  const { sort = identity } = props;

  const sorted = sort(SOME_ITEMS);
  // do whatever
  return null;
}
```

## Parameters

- `thing` - anything that has a type

The parameter that was provided
