# getTransitionCallbacks [$SOURCE](packages/core/src/transitions/getTransitionCallbacks.ts)

```ts disableTransform
function getTransitionCallbacks(
  options: GetTransitionCallbacksOptions
): Required<TransitionCallbacks>;
```

This is a helper function for applying specific effects to the transition
callbacks when transitions might be disabled. This is probably an internal only
function, but might be useful externally as well. Here are a few examples for
it's usage internally.

## Examples

See one of the following internal examples:

- [useAutocomplete]($GITHUB/packages/core/src/autocomplete/useAutocomplete.ts#L352)
- [useCombobox]($GITHUB/packages/core/src/form/useCombobox.ts#L488)
- [useFocusContainer]($GITHUB/packages/core/src/focus/useFocusContainer.ts#L183)

## Parameters

- `options` - an object with the following definition:

```ts disableTransform
export interface GetTransitionCallbacksOptions extends TransitionCallbacks {
  /**
   * Set this to `true` if the `onEnterOnce` callback should be triggered for
   * the `onEnter` callback instead of `onEntering`.
   *
   * @defaultValue `false`
   */
  enter?: boolean;

  /**
   * If this function is provided, it will be called:
   *
   * - `onEntered` if `disableTransition` is `true` or
   *   `TRANSITION_CONFIG.disabled` is `true`
   * - otherwise:
   *   - `onEnter` if `enter` is `true`
   *   - `onEntering` if `enter` is `false` or not provided
   */
  onEnterOnce?: TransitionEnterHandler;

  /**
   * Set this to `true` if the `onExitOnce` callback should be triggered for
   * the `onExit` callback instead of `onExiting`.
   *
   * @defaultValue `false`
   */
  exit?: boolean;

  /**
   * If this function is provided, it will be called:
   *
   * - `onExited` if `disableTransition` is `true` or
   *   `TRANSITION_CONFIG.disabled` is `true`
   * - otherwise:
   *   - `onExit` if `enter` is `true`
   *   - `onExiting` if `enter` is `false` or not provided
   */
  onExitOnce?: TransitionExitHandler;

  /**
   * Set this to `true` if the component has manually disabled transitions.
   *
   * @defaultValue `false`
   */
  disableTransition?: boolean;
}

  /**
   * This function will be called once the {@link TransitionStage} has been set
   * to `"enter"`.
   *
   * NOTE: This callback will be skipped when transitions are disabled. Use the
   * `getTransitionCallbacks` helper if something should only be called once
   * while entering.
   */
  onEnter?: TransitionEnterHandler;

  /**

   * to `"enter"`.
   *
   * NOTE: This callback will be skipped when transitions are disabled. Use the

   * to `"entered"`.
   *
   * NOTE: This callback will be skipped when transitions are disabled. Use the
   * `getTransitionCallbacks` helper if something should only be called once
   * while exiting.
   */
  onExit?: TransitionExitHandler;

  /**
   * This function will be called once the {@link TransitionStage} has been set
   * to `"exiting"`.
   *
   * NOTE: This callback will be skipped when transitions are disabled. Use the
   * `getTransitionCallbacks` helper if something should only be called once
   * while exiting.
   */
  onExiting?: TransitionExitHandler;

  /**
   * This function will be called once the {@link TransitionStage} has been set
   * to `"exited"`.
   */
  onExited?: TransitionExitHandler;
}

export type TransitionEnterStage = "enter" | "entering" | "entered";
export type TransitionExitStage = "exit" | "exiting" | "exited";
export type TransitionStage = TransitionEnterStage | TransitionExitStage;

/**
 * This function is called at each `"enter"` {@link TransitionStage}. If a
 * {@link TransitionOptions.nodeRef} was provided, the DOM node should be
 * available in `nodeRef.current` by this point if the transition requires DOM
 * calculations.
 *
 * @param appearing - Boolean if this is the initial `appear` flow.
 */
export type TransitionEnterHandler = (appearing: boolean) => void;

/**
 * This function is called at each `"exit"` {@link TransitionStage}. If a
 * {@link TransitionOptions.nodeRef} was provided, the DOM node should be
 * available in `nodeRef.current` by this point if the transition requires DOM
 * calculations.
 *
 * @since 4.0.0
 */
export type TransitionExitHandler = () => void;
```

## Returns

An object of `TransitionCallbacks` to pass to the transitional component.
