# useAppSize

```ts
function useAppSize(): Readonly<AppSize>;
```

The `useAppSize` hook should be used to update the **functionality** depending
on the current viewport size in React components through multiple media queries.

## Prerequisites

Either the [CoreProviders](/components/core-providers) or
[AppSizeProvider](/components/app-size-provider) component must be mounted for
this hook to work correctly.

## Example Usage

```tsx
import { useAppSize } from "@react-md/core/media-queries/AppSizeProvider";

function Example() {
  const { isPhone, isTablet, isDesktop, isLargeDesktop, isLandscape } =
    useAppSize();

  // do something based on the app size
  return null;
}
```

> !Info! See the [AppSizeProvider](/components/app-size-provider) for additional examples and configuration.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

```ts disableTransform
export interface AppSize {
  /**
   * Boolean if currently matching a phone by comparing the max width of the
   * device.
   */
  isPhone: boolean;

  /**
   * Boolean if currently matching a tablet by comparing the max width of the
   * device.
   */
  isTablet: boolean;

  /**
   * Boolean if currently matching a desktop screen by comparing the max width
   * of the device.
   */
  isDesktop: boolean;

  /**
   * Boolean if currently matching a large desktop screen by comparing the max
   * width of the device.
   */
  isLargeDesktop: boolean;

  /**
   * Boolean if the app is considered to be in landscape mode. This will just
   * verify that the window width is greater than the window height.
   *
   * NOTE: This might not be super accurate on Android devices since the soft
   * keyboard will change the dimensions of the viewport when it appears. It is
   * recommended to use the `useOrientation` hook as well if you'd like to get
   * the current orientation type.
   */
  isLandscape: boolean;
}
```
