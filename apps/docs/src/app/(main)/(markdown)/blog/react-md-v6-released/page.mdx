# react-md v6 is out now ðŸŽ‰

## New Features

### Box Component

This is probably one of the most useful components to be added to react-md. The
[Box](/components/box) component is a wrapper around the CSS box model for
`display: flex` and `display: grid` and can be used to implement most of the
DOM structure or layout without custom styling.

With the introduction of the `Box` component, the
[Grid](https://v5.react-md.dev/packages/utils/demos#material-grid-example),
`Griditem`, and
[GridList](https://v5.react-md.dev/packages/utils/demos#simple-grid-list)
components have been removed.

### Latest Material Icons and Material Symbols support

> !Info! All the available icons can be found using the new
> [Material Icons and Symbols](/components/material-icons-and-symbols) page.

The `@react-md/material-icons` package has been updated to support the latest
material icons but only through SVG icons. To continue using font icons, either
use the new `MaterialIcon` component or the `FontIcon` component.

Material symbols can be used through the new `MaterialSymbol` component
that supports customizing the weight, grade, and optical size globally,
for a section of the app, or one offs.

### Autocomplete usability

If you've used react-md in the past, you'll probably know that the
`Autocomplete` "worked" but wasn't user friendly or useful. With this version
of react-md, the `Autocomplete` has been remade to improve the user experience
by acting more like an editable `Select` component. So the `Autocomplete`
is more in line with the [react-select](https://react-select.com) and the
[material-ui Autocomplete](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/).

Here's a quick summary of the new changes:

- The default behavior requires a valid option to be selected and will reset to
  the last valid option or an empty string
- Multiple values are now supported with optional inline chips or checkboxes
- Circular progress bars are now supported
- The selected option and input value can both be controlled
- The component API should hopefully make more sense without the
  `getResultLabel`, `getResultValue`, ... whatever I was doing before
- More type safety

<div style={{ maxWidth: "20rem", width: "100%", margin: "0 auto" }}>
  <SimpleAutocomplete />
</div>

### Improved Alert, Toast, and Snackbar API

The toasts and alerts have been updated so toasts can be shown from anywhere
instead of only within React components with the `useAddToast` hook. Toasts
can now be created by importing the new `addToast` function.

```tsx
import { Snackbar } from "@react-md/core/snackbar/Snackbar";
import { addToast } from "@react-md/core/snackbar/ToastManager";
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

import "./index.scss";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RootProviders>
      <App />
    </RootProviders>
  </StrictMode>
);

// doesn't need to be called from react components!
window.setTimeout(() => {
  addToast({ children: "Hello, world!" });
}, 3000);
```

Some other new features for snackbars and toasts are:

- supports the theme colors
- allows configuring the visible time on a per-toast basis
- the toast timeout pauses while the user hovers the toast
- multiple toasts can be rendered at once
- new customization through a custom toast renderer prop

Check out the new [snackbar demos](/components/snackbar) to see more!

### Better dark mode support

The dark mode has been improved so that the interaction states are now visible
by default when switching to the dark mode. The following images show the
normal, hover, then focus states for a button with the dark theme enabled.

Before:

<MarkdownImage
  src={import("./normal-hover-focus-before.png")}
  alt="Interaction states before v6"
/>

After

<MarkdownImage
  src={import("./normal-hover-focus-after.png")}
  alt="Interaction states with v6"
/>

As you can see, the hover and focus states could not be seen by default in
previous versions but now will automatically use the background inverse color
to apply the correct styles.

Other native elements like the `<select>` should also update based on the dark
mode color scheme.

### Simplified Slider and supporting marks

The `Slider` component has been simplified and now only requires a `value` and
`setValue` to use. Due to these changes, the `RangeSlider` is no longer
required and has been merged into the `Slider` component.

In addition, the `Slider` component now supports rendering marks below to help
show where specific values are within the range.

<CustomizingSliderMarks />

### Overflow Only Tooltips

Tooltips now support being shown only if there is overflow text. Check out the
[Overflow Only Tooltip](/components/tooltip#overflow-only-tooltip) demo for
more information!

### New responsive CSS util

A simple [objectFit](/utils/object-fit) utility function has been created for
styling images, videos, and other media types. This should be able to replace
most of the `MediaContainer` / `ResponsiveItem` usage in your app with better
styling behavior.

### New Tab Component Features

The `Tab` components have been updated to support:

- [scrolling with buttons](/components/tabs#scrollable-tabs) instead of the
  hidden scrollbar option that existed before
- [being rendered vertically](/components/tabs#vertical-tabs)
- maintaining a consistent tab panel height using the new
  [useMaxTabPanelHeight](/components/tabs#use-max-tab-panel-height) hook

### Tree Expansion Mode

The `Tree` component has been updated with a few new customization options like
the [expansionMode](/components/tree#expansion-mode) which allows the child
tree items to only become visible after clicking the icon instead of anywhere
in the tree item.

### Circular Progress and Linear Progress Colors

The `CircularProgress` and `LinearProgress` components now support the
`primary`, `secondary`, `warning`, `success`, `error`, and `current-color`
themes.

### Class Name Utility Functions

Most components now expose a class name utility function to provide styles without
using the component itself. The naming conventions are to use a
`camelCasedName` instead of `PascalCased`. For example:

- `button` for the `Button` component
- `expansionPanel` for the `ExpansionPanel` component
- `typography` for the `Typography` component

In addition, a general [cssUtils](/utils/css-utils) helper has been created for
common styling.

### Test utils with jest and vitest

New polyfills and test utils are now provided that integrate with
[jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) to improve
testing. Check out the [testing quickstart guide](/testing/quickstart)
on how to get started.

### New Components and Hooks

A few new components and hooks have been added:

- [AsyncButton](/components/button#async-button)
- [CircularProgressSuspense](/components/suspense#circular-progress-suspense)

## Improvements

### Documentation ðŸŽ‰

The documentation site has been remade to hopefully improve finding information
with the following changes:

- Navigation is based on component, hook, or feature instead of package.
- Examples and demos have been trimmed down to focus on a single feature and
  file at a time. There are a few more complex examples near the end.
- Most examples and demos can be edited and previewed within the website
  instead of needing to create a codesandbox
- The code editor theme can be configured in the global settings menu

### Checkbox and Radio Icon Styling

The `Checkbox` and `Radio` components no longer use some hacky CSS to overlay
the checked icon state to show the unchecked state. Instead, both icons are
rendered and toggled using CSS and the `:checked` state allowing for easier
customization.

### CSS Variables are visible through CSSProperties

If a react-md component is imported that uses CSS variables, the variables will now
become visible and type-checkable with typescript when defining inline styles.

```tsx
import { Avatar } from "@react-md/core/avatar";

function Example() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        // no longer a type error!
        "--rmd-avatar-color": "orange",
        "--rmd-avatar-border-radius": "0.5rem",
      }}
    >
      <Avatar>A</Avatar>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### No more layout shifts while enabling scroll lock

The new scroll locking behavior prevents layout shifts by calculating the
current scrollbar size and applying padding to the root element. This can
drastically improve performance for apps that rely on resize observers to
position content.

### Lower CSS specificity

The styles have been re-written to always have the lowest
[CSS specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Specificity)
allowing custom styles to override react-md with ease.

### Use `:focus-visible` instead of `.keyboard-mode`

The `:focus` styles for almost every component now uses `:focus-visible`
instead of relying on `.keyboard mode &:focus` removing the
`UserInteractionModeProvider` requirement from these styles. If the previous
focus behavior is desired, set [$SASSDOC]($disable-focus-visible) to `true`

### The `id` prop is no longer required

All react-md components that required an `id` now default to
[useId()](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId) and can be omitted.

### SSR Rehydration

By enabling a new `ssr` mode in the
[CoreProviders](/components/core-providers), temporary components like dialogs
and overlays will remain visible and mounted after being rendered on the server
until the first time they are unmounted.

In addition, the general layout has been updated to handle SSR behavior better
by relying on media queries for switching between layout types instead of only
requiring javascript. Check out the new [layout documentation](/getting-started/layout)
for more examples.

### React StrictMode and 19 Support

Every [StrictMode](react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode) error has been fixed
and react-md is ready for React 19. The documentation site has been using the
[React 19 RC](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19) for a long time without
issue. In addition, it is now possible to prevent the entire app from being
marked as a client boundary when importing a component from react-md. Each
component and hook has been correctly marked with the `"use client"` directive
as needed.

### Shared Portal Node

The [Portal](/components/portal) has been updated to render all content within
a `<div id="rmd-portal-container" />` by default instead of the `document.body`.
This allows quick access in the dev-tools to inspecting portal elements and
preventing any issues that might appear for rendering additional nodes in the
`document.body`.

### Improved dev build times

With the migration to ESM, the `@react-md/core` package has been created to
only support importing from specific paths instead of a
[root barrel file](https://vite.dev/guide/performance#avoid-barrel-files).
This will improve development speed as bundlers will no longer need to fetch
all files within react-md to begin compiling.

The base `react-md` package will still support a root barrel file import if
this is not a concern.

```diff
-import { Card, CardTitle } from "@react-md/card";
+import { Card } from "@react-md/core/card/Card";
+import { CardTitle } from "@react-md/core/card/CardTitle";

 // âœ… This still works, but will result in slower dev builds
 import { Card, CardTitle } from "react-md";
```

### Better Dev Tools Support

In prior versions of react-md, inspecting CSS variables could be difficult
because they were split into multiple rules without using `postcss` plugins.
Starting with react-md@v6, custom properties will automatically be grouped
together in the devtools.

### Slightly Smaller Bundle Sizes

The gzipped sizes have decreased slightly with the latest version of react-md:

- Javascript: 92.51 kB to 82.77 kB
- SCSS: 18.08 kB to 16.55 kB
  - NOTE: This was the smallest theme bundle with `$primary-color: $grey-500`,
    `$secondary-color: $red-700`, `$color-scheme: light` for both version of react-md

## Breaking Changes

There were a lot of breaking changes, but a few will be called out here specifically.

### ESM and new Sass modules only

react-md will now only support ESM going forward since most build tools already
support it. In addition, the legacy `@import` syntax is no longer supported for
Sass.
