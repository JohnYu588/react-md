# Overlay

An `Overlay` is an element that normally covers the entire screen and prevents
content behind it from being interactable.

# Simple Overlay

An `Overlay` dynamically renders itself based on a `visible` prop with a simple
opacity transition. An `Overlay` should normally have an `onClick` handler that
hide the overlay.

{{ "component": "./SimpleOverlayExample.tsx" }}

## Invisible Overlay

If the `Overlay` should be rendered with another element and act as a way to
"close on outside click" without clicking other elements, enable the `noOpacity`
prop.

{{ "component": "./InvisibleOverlayExample.tsx" }}

# Overlay with Content

The `Overlay` can also render `children` if and supports the box `align-items`
and `justify-content`.

{{ "component": "./OverlayWithContentExample.tsx" }}
