# Sr Only

The `SrOnly` component can be used to render accessible labels that are only
visible to screen readers by default.

# Simple Example

The most common usage for the `SrOnly` component is to add text to an icon
button when a label cannot be provided by the `aria-label`.

> demo to see how to switch from an icon button to a text button based on media
> queries.

```tsx
// preview editable
import { Button, SrOnly } from "@react-md/core";
import FavoriteIcon from "@react-md/material-icons/FavoriteIcon";
import { type ReactElement } from "react";

export default function SimpleExample(): ReactElement {
  return (
    <Button buttonType="icon">
      <SrOnly>Example Text</SrOnly>
      <FavoriteIcon />
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Visible while Focused

The text can also become visible while focused if needed by enabling the
`focusable` prop. Tab into the next demo to see the text.

```tsx
// preview editable
import { SrOnly } from "@react-md/core";
import { type ReactElement } from "react";

export default function VisibleWhileFocusedExample(): ReactElement {
  return <SrOnly focusable>This should appear while focused!</SrOnly>;
}
```
