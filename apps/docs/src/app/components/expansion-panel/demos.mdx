# Expansion Panel

An expansion panel enables content to be either collapsed (hidden) or expanded
(visible) following the
[disclosure pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/).

# Simple Example

An `ExpansionPanel` is a required component requiring an `expanded` state and
`onExpandClick` function to toggle the expanded state. The children will be
dynamically shown whenever `expanded` is `true`. The toggle button's children
can be defined using the `headerChildren` prop.

{{ "component": "./SimpleExample.tsx" }}

# Expansion Panel Group

If multiple `ExpansionPanel`s should be used together in a group, wrap them in
the `ExpansionList` component to add additional keyboard accessibility. The
`useExpansionPanels` hook can also be used to control the expanded state for
each panel.

The `useExpansionPanels` hook will default to allowing only one panel to be
visible at a time and all panels collapsed. Check out the following examples for
additional `useExpansionPanels` options.

{{ "component": "./ExpansionPanelGroupExample.tsx" }}

## Multiple Expanded Panels

If multiple panels should be able to be expanded at the same time, enable the
`multiple` option. This demo will also show how the `defaultExpandedIndex` can
be used to expand a single panel by default.

{{ "component": "./MultipleExpandedPanelsExample.tsx" }}

## Prevent All Panels Collapsed

The `preventAllCollapsed` option can be used to ensure at least one panel is
always expanded and defaults to expanding the first panel.

{{ "component": "./PreventAllPanelsCollapsedExample.tsx" }}

## String-based Panel Props

If the expansion panel should be identified by a unique id instead of an index,
that unique id can be passed to `getPanelProps` instead. This also allows for
specific panels to be expanded by default.

{{ "component": "./StringBasedPanelPropsExample.tsx" }}

# Disable Transition

The collapse transition can be disabled by enabling the `disableTransition`
prop.

{{ "component": "./DisableTransitionExample.tsx" }}

## Temporary Contents

The `ExpansionPanel` will hide collapsed content by using `display: none` but
can dynamically render it instead by enabling the `temporary` prop. Dynamically
rendering can be helpful if the children's state should reset each time it
becomes visible.

{{ "component": "./TemporaryContentsExample.tsx" }}
