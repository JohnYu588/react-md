# Table

Tables display sets of data across rows and columns.

# Simple Example

A table can be created using the following components:

- `Table` - A styled `<table>`
- `TableHeader` - A styled `<thead>`
- `TableBody` - A `<tbody>` with some additional behavior defined later
- `TableFooter` - A styled `<tfoot>` with some additional behavior defined later
- `TableRow` - A styled `<tr>` with some additional behavior defined later
- `TableCell` - A styled `th` or `td`. Rendered as a `th` when a child of the
  `TableHeader` and a `td` otherwise.

The `TableRow` will default to rendering a border on the bottom and a different
background color while hovered when in the `TableBody`.

A [caption](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption)
can be added by using the `Typography` component.

{{ "component": "./SimpleTableExample.tsx" }}

## Disable Hover Styles

The row hover styles that appear on all the `TableRow` in the `TableBody` can be
configured on the `Table`, `TableBody`, or `TableRow`components with
the`disableHover`prop. The `TableRow` will inherit this value or override the
inherited value if defined.

{{ "component": "./DisableHoverExample.tsx" }}

## Disable Border Styles

The bottom border that appears on all `TableRow` in the `TableBody` can be
removed by enabling the `disableBorders` prop on the `Table`, `TableBody`, or
`TableRow` components. The `TableRow` will inherit this value or override the
inherited value if defined.

{{ "component": "./DisableBordersExample.tsx" }}

# Scrollable Tables

If a table should be scrollable, wrap it in a `TableContainer`. The
`TableContainer` allows scrolling horizontally and vertically by adding:

```css
.rmd-table-container {
  max-width: 100%;
  overflow: auto;
}
```

{{ "component": "./ScrollableTableExample.tsx" }}

# Selectable Rows

A common pattern with tables are to make the rows selectable so different
actions can be applied. A `TableRow` can be updated to have a `selected` state
which will add a different background color and a `clickable` state that updates
the cursor to be a pointer.

{{ "component": "./SelectableRowsExample.tsx" }}

## Selectable Rows with Checkbox

It is recommended to use the `TableCheckbox` component as the first cell in each
row to help show the row can be selected and the
[useCheckboxGroup](/hooks/use-checkbox-group) hook to control the selected
state.

{{ "component": "./SelectableRowsWithCheckboxExample.tsx" }}

## Selectable Rows with Radio

If only one row can be selected at a time, the `TableRadio` component can be
used instead.

{{ "component": "./SelectableRowsWithRadioExample.tsx" }}

## Updating Selected Row Color

The selected background color defaults to
`core.interaction-get-var(selected-background-color)`. This can be configured by
the `core.$table-row-selected-color` Sass variable or the
`--rmd-table-selected-background-color` custom property.

If the text color and hover colors also need to change while selected, it is
recommended to just add a custom `className` while selected instead. Here's a
quick example of using the primary color while selected.

{{ "component": "./UpdatingSelectedRowColorExample.tsx" }}

# Sortable Columns

To create a sortable header cell, provide the `aria-sort` prop to a `TableCell`
as one of the following values:

- `"ascending"` - The data has been sorted in ascending order. So A-z, 0-9, and
  earlier dates before later dates.
- `"descending"` The data has been sorted in descending order. So z-A, 9-0, and
  later dates before earlier dates.
- `"other"` - The data has been sorted in another programmatic order.
- `"none"` - The data has not been sorted ("aria-sort" default)

When the `aria-sort` prop has been set to one of these values, the cell will
automatically update the children to be rendered within a button element so that
it can be tab-focused and clickable for keyboard users. However when the sort
behavior has been set to `none`, only the button element will be rendered
without the current sort icon to show that it is not currently sorted, but can
be.

{{ "component": "./SortableColumnsExample.tsx" }}

## Customizing Sort Icon

The sortable `TableCell` component will use the
[sort](/customization/icon-config#sort) icon from the `ICON_CONFIG` by default
but can also be configured by providing the `sortIcon` prop.

The sort icon can also be placed after the children by enabling the
`sortIconAfter` prop and disable the rotation transition by enabling
`disableTransition` to the `iconRotatorProps`.
