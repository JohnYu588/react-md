# Dialog

Dialogs inform users about a task and can contain critical information, require
decisions, or involve multiple tasks.

A dialog is a type of modal window that appears in front of app content to
provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app
functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed,
or a required action has been taken.

# Simple Example

A dialog can be created using the `Dialog`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogTitle`,
`DialogContent`, and `DialogFooter` components. The `Dialog` is a controlled
component requiring a `visible` state, `onRequestClose` function to close the
dialog, and either an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for accessibility.

A common pattern is to set the `aria-labelledby` to the `DialogTitle` since the
title would normally describe the purpose of the dialog.

{{ "component": "./SimpleExample.tsx" }}

## Full Page Dialog

A dialog can span the entire viewport by setting the `type` to `"full-page"`.

{{ "component": "./FullPageDialogExample.tsx" }}

# Modal Dialog

The default behavior for the dialog is to allow the user to click the overlay to
close the dialog. If the user should be forced to interact with the modal to
close it, enable the `modal` prop.

When the `modal` prop is enabled, the `role` should normally switch to an
[alertdialog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/alertdialog_role)
to increase the accessibility. An `aria-describedby` should also be set on the
dialog to describe the alert.

{{ "component": "./ModalDialogExample.tsx" }}

# Setting the Initial Focus

When the dialog gains visibility, the current focus will move to the dialog
itself and trap focus within the dialog. If another element in the dialog should
gain focus instead, enable the `autoFocus` prop on that element.

{{ "component": "./SettingInitialFocusExample.tsx" }}

# Custom Transition

The `Dialog` uses the [useCSSTransition](/hooks/use-css-transition) to handle
the visibility transitions and can be customized by providing the `timeout` and
`classNames` props.

{{ "component": "./CustomTransitionExample.tsx" }}
