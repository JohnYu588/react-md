# Switch

Switches toggle the state of a single item on or off and are the preferred way to adjust settings on mobile.

Use switches to:

- Toggle a single item on or off, on mobile and tablet
- Immediately activate or deactivate something

# Simple Switch

A switch can be created using the `Switch` component. A `label` should normally be provided
for accessibility purposes.

{{ "component": "./SimpleSwitch.tsx" }}

## Icon After Label

The label can be placed before the switch icon by enabling the `iconAfter` prop.

{{ "component": "./IconAfterLabel.tsx" }}

## Stacked Label

The label can be stacked above or below the switch by enabling the `stacked` prop.

{{ "component": "./StackedSwitch.tsx" }}

# Switch Sizes

The `Switch` will automatically scale the label and switch toggle based on the
current `font-size`. Apply the `font-size` only to the
`trackStyle`/`trackClassName` if only the switch toggle should change size.

{{ "component": "./SwitchSizes.tsx" }}

# Switch States

The `Switch` also has different states that can be applied. The most common will
be the `error` or `disabled` states but also supports `active`.

{{ "component": "./SwitchStates.tsx" }}

# Controlling Switches

The `Switch` can be controlled by providing the `checked` prop and `onChange`
like a native `<input type="checkbox">`:

{{ "component": "./ControllingSwitches.tsx" }}

# Switch with Messages

The `Switch` component is wrapped in the
[FormMessageContainer](/components/form-message#form-message-container) so additional
hint or error messages can be displayed.

{{ "component": "./SwitchWithMessages.tsx" }}

# Switch with Circular Progress

The `Switch` can has been updated to support rendering a `CircularProgress`
within the ball by using the `ballAddon` prop.

> !Info! The `ballAddon` can also be used to render icons, but some additional
> styles will be required to update the color of the icon between the unchecked
> and checked states.

{{ "component": "./SwitchWithCircularProgress.tsx" }}
