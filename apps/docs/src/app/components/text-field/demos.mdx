# Text Field

[Text fields](https://m2.material.io/components/text-fields#usage) allow users
to enter text into a UI. They typically appear in forms and dialogs.

# Simple Text Field

The default text field will look similar to a native `<input type="text">`
with a border surrounding the text content that will change color and thickness
when hovered or focused. Every text field should have an accessible label by
providing one of the following props: `label`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`.

It is generally recommended to
[place a label with the text field](https://m2.material.io/components/text-fields#research),
but placeholder only text fields are also supported.

{{ "component": "./OutlinedTextField.tsx" }}

## Filled Text Field

Filled text fields have more visual emphasis than outlined text fields, making
them stand out when surrounded by other content and components.

{{ "component": "./FilledTextField.tsx" }}

## Underlined Text Field

Underlined text fields have the least emphasis, making them better for less
prominent editing.

{{ "component": "./UnderlinedTextField.tsx" }}

## No Theme Text Field

The text field can also be set with `theme="none"` which removes most of the
styling behavior. There isn't much use for this though since the floating label
will not display correctly when this is set and can only be used for placeholder
only text fields.

{{ "component": "./NoThemeTextField.tsx" }}

# Text Field State

The text field supports the following states:

- `disabled` - Greys out the input and prevents modifications
- `readOnly` - Normal styles but prevents modifications
- `error` - Applies the theme error color (normally red)
- `active` - Applies the focus state if it is required to be manually be
  triggered

{{ "component": "./TextFieldState.tsx" }}

# Text Field Type

The text field supports rendering as most of the [input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types)
that are displayed as a textbox. There is no additional functionality built-in
to support these types other than attempting to display them correctly.

{{ "component": "./TextFieldType.tsx" }}

## Password

When rendering password fields, it is recommended to use the `Password`
component instead which will allow the user to toggle the visibility of the
password.

{{ "component": "./PasswordExample.tsx" }}

## Number

The default browser implementation `<input type="number">` leaves much to be
desired so a `useNumberField` hook is provided to fix the following issues and
additional type safety.

- the value will only be `undefined` if the `defaultValue` provided was
  `undefined`
- displays an error message when the user types an invalid number. These are
  _technically_ valid numbers in the browser implementation: `--0`, `0-0`,
  `0-0-`, `++0`, etc
- attempts to fix the number on blur:
  - `00000` -> `0`
  - `001` -> `1`
  - `1e+3` -> `1000`
  - enforce the value between the `min` and `max` values (if provided)

See more info at the [useNumberField documentation](/hooks/use-number-field).
