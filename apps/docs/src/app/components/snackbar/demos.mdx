# Snackbar

Snackbars provide brief messages about app processes at the bottom of the
screen.

# Initialize Snackbar

An application should normally have a single `Snackbar` added near the root of
the application.

```diff
-import { CoreProviders } from "@react-md/core";
+import { CoreProviders, Snackbar } from "@react-md/core";
 import rmdConfig from "./rmdConfig.jsx";


 return (
   <CoreProviders {...rmdConfig}>
     {children}
+    <Snackbar />
   </CoreProviders>
 );
```

# Simple Toast

Once the `Snackbar` component has been included in the application, toasts
can be added by using the `addToast` function. Simple messages can be created
by providing the `children` as the toast content.

The default behavior for toasts:

- Add a toast to the end of the queue
- Once a toast becomes visible, show it for 5 seconds
  - Pause the timeout if the user hovers the toast
  - Pause the timeout if the user blurs the window
- Hide the toast and display the next toast in the queue

{{ "component": "./SimpleToastExample.tsx" }}

## Multiple Lines

The `children` for the toast can also be any renderable element and span
multiple lines.

{{ "component": "./MultipleLinesToastExample.tsx" }}

## Toast Theme

The `Toast` supports all the theme colors by setting the `theme`.

{{ "component": "./ToastThemeExample.tsx" }}

## Custom Toast Visible Time

If the default duration of 5 seconds does not work for a specific toast, set the
`visibleTime` to a duration in milliseconds to wait before hiding the toast.

{{ "component": "./CustomToastVisibleTimeExample.tsx" }}

## Toast Position

# Add a Close Button

If a toast should be able to be dismissed early, a close button can be added by
adding `closeButton: true` when creating the toast. The close button will
default to having an `aria-label="Close"` and using the
[close](/customization/icon-config#close) icon.

{{ "component": "./AddACloseButtonExample.tsx" }}

## Close Button Props

If custom props are required for the close button, provide `closeButtonProps`
instead.

{{ "component": "./CloseButtonPropsExample.tsx" }}

# Actionable Toasts

A toast can be updated to have an action button appear to the right of the
message by providing an `action` object. It should normally have a simple
`onClick` event handler and `children` to display in the button.

{{ "component": "./ActionableToastExample.tsx" }}

## Action and Close Button

Both an action and close button can be displayed together.

{{ "component": "./ActionAndCloseButtonExample.tsx" }}

## Require an action

If an action **must** be clicked to hide the toast, set the `visibleTime` to
`null`.

{{ "component": "./RequireAnActionExample.tsx" }}

## Custom Action Button

If the action is complex and requires additional behavior, provide an
`actionButton` instead.

{{ "component": "./CustomActionButtonExample.tsx" }}

# Custom Toast Manager

If multiple `Snackbar` need to be mounted at the same time, create a new
`ToastManager` and wrap the React tree with the `ToastManagerProvider`. Now
toasts should be created by calling `manager.addToast` or the `addToast`
returned by `useAddToast`.

This example will give a quick example and show how the `Snackbar` can be
updated to have `toastDefaults`.

{{ "component": "./CustomToastManagerExample.tsx" }}

# Preventing Duplicate Toasts

The default behavior allows multiple toasts with the same content to be added
into the queue because each toast gets a unique `toastId` generated by
[nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) when added into the queue. Since this
might not be ideal, toast timers can automatically restart if the same content
is added into the queue. Manually set the `toastId` when adding a toast to
enable this feature.

> !Success! This feature does not require a custom toast manager to work outside
> of these demos. The custom toast manager was only added to support multiple
> `Snackbar` examples.
