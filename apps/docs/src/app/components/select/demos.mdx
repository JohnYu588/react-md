# Select

`Select` components allow users to select a single option from a popup list.
This component mimics the API for a native `<select>` element but supports
additional styling.

> !Info! See the [AutoComplete](/components/autocomplete) component for
> typeahead or fuzzy searching of options.

> !Warn! The `Select` component will not be populated by password managers or
> the browser's autofill feature since the `<input>` element is hidden and
> non-interactive. Use the [NativeSelect](/components/native-select) to allow
> for autofill behavior for things like a state in the United States in an
> address form.

# Simple Select

A select can be created by using the `Select` and `Option` components together.
Each option should have a unique `value` and some sort of text.

{{ "component": "./SimpleSelect.tsx" }}

## Select Theme

Just like other form components, the `Select` supports multiple themes:
`outline` (default), `filled`, or `underline`.

{{ "component": "./SelectTheme.tsx" }}

## Controlled Select

The `value` for the select can be controlled by providing a `value` and
`onChange` handler where the `value` should match one of the `Option`'s `value`s.

> !Info! The `event.currentTarget.value` will be strongly typed for Typescript users.

{{ "component": "./ControlledSelectExample.tsx" }}

## Uncontrolled Select with a Default Value

If the `Select` does not need to be controlled, a `defaultValue` can be provided
instead.

{{ "component": "./UncontrolledSelectExample.tsx" }}

# Grouped Options

Related options can be wrapped in an `OptGroup` to provide additional context
for the options. The `OptGroup` must have a label for accessibility.

{{ "component": "./SelectionGroupsExample.tsx" }}

# Custom Dropdown Icon

The `Select` component will use the
[dropdown](/customization/icon-config#dropdown) icon from the `ICON_CONFIG` by
default for the dropdown icon. The icon can be configured by using the `icon`
prop if the icon should animate and rotate while opened or `rightAddon` prop
for no rotation and animation.

{{ "component": "./CustomDropdownIcon.tsx" }}

# Select with Addons

Just like the [TextField](/components/text-field), the `Select` supports
rendering a `leftAddon`. It does not really support a `rightAddon` out of the
box since that is normally the dropdown icon.

{{ "component": "./SelectWithAddons.tsx" }}

## Using Option Addons

If an option provides the `leftAddon` prop, it will automatically be added as
the `leftAddon` to the `Select` once it has been selected. This behavior can be
disabled by setting `disableOptionAddon` to `true`.

{{ "component": "./UsingOptionAddons.tsx" }}

## Removing Option Selected Icon

The `Option` component will use the
[selected](/customization/icon-config#selected) icon from the `ICON_CONFIG` by
default to help show which option has been selected. This can be disabled by
setting `disableSelectedIcon` to `true` on the `Select` component.

{{ "component": "./RemovingOptionSelectedIconExample.tsx" }}

## Selected Icon After

The selected icon can be rendered after the `children` by enabling the
`selectedIconAfter` prop on each option.

{{ "component": "./SelectedIconAfterExample.tsx" }}

## Adding an Unselected Icon

An icon could also be added for the unselected state with the `unselectedIcon`
prop on the `Option`.

{{ "component": "./AddingAnUnselectedIcon.tsx" }}

# Menu Options

The `Select` uses the [Menu](/components/menu) behind the scenes and can pass
additional props via the `menuProps`.

The example below will showcase how the select's menu can be updated to use
`equal` width instead of `min` and preventing the menu from overlapping the
input. Try changing the `width` value and the long-text `Option` props to see
how the menu behaves.

{{ "component": "./MenuOptionsExample.tsx" }}

## Rendering in a Sheet

The options can be rendered within a sheet on mobile or other screen sizes if
needed. Check out the
[Rendering in a Sheet](http://localhost:3000/components/menu#rendering-in-a-sheet)
menu documentation for more information.

{{ "component": "./RenderingWithinASheet.tsx" }}

# Accessibility

The `Select` component implements everything for a [select only combobox](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/)
which means:

- `Space` will open the menu to show all the options and an option can be chosen
  by `Enter` or `Space`
- the `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `Home`, and `End` keys can be used to select a
  value while the list is open or closed
- the first match will be found when typing a letter or number and repeated
  presses will loop through all options that start with that letter or number
  - `Shift` + a letter will always select the first match`
- the `Enter` key will submit the `<form>` while the list is closed like a
  native `<select>`

{{ "component": "./AccessibilityExample.tsx" }}
