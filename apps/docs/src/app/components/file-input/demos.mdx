# File Input

A `FileInput` is used to prompt a user to select a single or multiple files which can be:

- Previewed client side
- Sent to the server for processing

# Simple File Input

A `FileInput` includes all the styles from the [Button component](/components/button)
but defaults to a primary themed icon button with an accessible label of
`Upload` and an upload icon. If `children` are passed to the `FileInput`, it
will be rendered as a primary themed text button with an upload icon before the
`children`.

> !Warn! Unlike the native `<input type="file">`, the current selected file will not be shown.
> Check out the examples below to see how to control the value.
