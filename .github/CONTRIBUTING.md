# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to `react-md` and its
packages. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## I don't want to read the whole thing I just want to ask a question!<!-- force-heading -->

If you have a question about how to use `react-md`, getting started, or general
styling questions, please do not create an issue. Instead, join the [official
Slack channel] where someone will hopefully answer your question for you.

> You will need an invite to join the official Slack channel, but luckily you
> can get an invite by entering your email into the automated invite site:
> https://react-md.herokuapp.com
>
> Note: this invite site is running on a heroku free tier plan, so if you try to
> get an invite near the end of the month, this site might be down. If you need
> to join immediately, you can send an email to mlaursen03@gmail.com with a
> subject of "react-md Slack invite". You can also use this [email template].

## Did you find a bug?

If you found a bug, **first** search the existing issues to see if it has
already been reported. If the bug has not been reported, create an issue on
GitHub using the bug report template and provide as much information as
possible. Attaching screenshots as well as a runnable code example using
[codesandbox] will help get a bugfix out quicker due to less debugging and
initial setup.

When creating the issue name, please be concise and focus on a specific package,
version, or browser that this occurs in. Here is a list of good bug issue
titles:

- The menu component does not render correctly in Firefox
- Applying a dynamic theme in mobile Safari does not work after version x
- The `ComponentName` in `@react-md/package` is not accessible

## Do you have a new feature request?

If you would like to see a new feature within `react-md`, please open an issue
on GitHub using the feature request template. To help the contributors
prioritize a feature, please provide as much information as possible any helpful
screenshots, or a link to a page on the [material design] website.

Since this project is really maintained by only one developer, the scope of
allowed features will be limited to:

- something related to material design
- adding additional accessibility
- ease-of-use to existing components

## Do you want to fix a bug or add a new feature?

Before you start working on a bug or feature, please make sure that there has
already been an issue filed and the fix/feature has been approved as a valid bug
or feature. From there, you'll want to follow the steps below which will outline
initial setup and other information.
